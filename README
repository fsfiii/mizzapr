mizzapr

A rockin' ruby DSL for map/reduce.  Have fun and kick java out the door.

Is there any demand for this sort of thing?  Mizappr is a only experimental
right now as I'm playing with ways to scale out the human side of
map/reduce development.  So *please* let me know if you're interested
in seeing more.

example code:

# map-only job to do filtering and processing based on fields
require_relative 'mizzapr'

index_for phone: 0
index_for key:   3
index_for name:  2
index_for age:   5

map_filter do |rec|
  rec[:age].to_i < 30
end

map_process do |rec|
  emit [rec[:key], rec[:name], rec[:phone], rec[:age].to_i - 1]
end

# canonical map/reduce wordcount - need to simplify

# mapper

require_relative 'mizzapr'

map_process do |rec|
  rec.split.each { |word| emit [word.downcase, 1] }
end

# reducer

require_relative 'mizzapr'

aggregate_sum :word, :count

reduce_finish do |rec|
  emit [rec[:word], rec[:count]]
end
